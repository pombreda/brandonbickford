This is a repository of Python and Haskell things I write which don't belong anywhere else, but that I want to share.

01/15 7am:
  * Added a compile-less python binding to taglib\_c (the C API for TagLib) called taglibc.  This uses the spiffy ctypes module and conditional expressions, so python2.5 or better is required.
  * Added some haskell learnings:
    * setgame.hs (game of Set model)
    * graph.hs (cyclic graph path search)
